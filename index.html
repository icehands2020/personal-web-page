  <h1>How to install a outlit</h1>  


<h4>by Derick M</h4>

<h2>The tools needed </h2>

<p>The tools i would recomend to install a outlit are the following. a pait of thin pliers,a screwdriver,a voltage meater,and a pair of protective gloves.I would also recomend a flash light if their is not a windo or other sorce of light in the room.</p>


<h2> steeps needes to het started</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is go over to your fuse box and turn off the power to the room you will be working in. This will prevent any electricity from chocking you while you work. you also need to make shure you have some light so you can see what your doing, use a plash light if you have one.</p>



<h2>Installing,repeplacing outlit.</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is use the voltage meater to cheak if their is any voltage going to the outlit. first turn on the meater and have it set to read live electrical currents.Once that is done, stick the two ends of the meater into the outlit, if the numbers on the meater remain at zero you are ready to begin.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is use the screw driver to remove the outlits cover.Once the cover is removed take out the two or more screws holding the outlit in. once you have it out theit should be thiree wires stached to the sides, a live wire, nutural and ground whire. the wire that is not wrapes in rubber is the ground whire, the nutural whire is usualy black or dark collered, and the live whire is collered white. The ground whire goes around the green screw at the bottom of the pluge.The nutural and live wire goes to the left and right of outlit. the nutural to the dark collered screw and the live whire to the silver collered screw. once you have the wires wraped around the screws use the pliers to tighten the wires around the bottom of the screw amd tighetn the screws with the screw driver.</p>

<p>If the wires wont go around the screws their should be four holles at the back of the outlit and you can insert the nutural, and live whires in the back corosponding to the screws they should be wraped around. once the wires are in you can place the outlit back in its spot and screw it back in. When the outlit is bacck in and you turned the power of the room back on, use the voltage reader to make shure power is flowing back into the new outlit.</p>
